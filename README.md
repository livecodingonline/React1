Hi Everyone!

### Sunday Session

#### Lecture

##### Why React?
####### React is popular

-You see a lot of job offers, that makes it right investmen on it
- Nowadays you see a lot of jQuery jobs on demand, that is because jQuery was the best before new libraries.
A lot of projects started with jQuery in that time period and now still you see a lot of job offers. 
That indicates even React is not popular in the future, you will still see alot of job offers..

####### React is modular

- There is component sctructure
- Each component has its HTML, CSS, Js
- Components are imported/exported
- Modularity bring reusability of codes


####### React is fast

- React doesn't use the DOM directy, (jQuery does)
- React uses something called VirtualDom
- React updates only required part in the DOM, (jQuery updates all)
- This update strategy makes React fast
